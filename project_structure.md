##mExplanation of Directories:
cmd/: Contains the main applications (executables) for your project.
cmd/api/main.go: The entry point for your API server. Its responsibilities:
Initialize configuration.
Initialize the logger.
Initialize repository implementations (e.g., in-memory or database).
Initialize service layer components, injecting repositories.
Initialize HTTP handlers, injecting services.
Set up the HTTP router and middleware.
Start the HTTP server.
internal/: Private application and library code. This is the heart of your application. Code here is not meant to be imported by other applications.
internal/config/:
config.go: Defines structs for configuration and functions to load it (e.g., from environment variables, config files).
internal/handler/http/: (Or just internal/http/)
open311_handler.go: Contains the HTTP handler functions (e.g., GetServices, CreateRequest). These handlers receive HTTP requests, parse them, call the appropriate service methods, and then format the HTTP response. They should be lean and delegate business logic to the service layer.
router.go: Sets up the HTTP routes, mapping URLs to handler functions. This is where you'd use http.NewServeMux() (or a third-party router like chi or gorilla/mux).
middleware.go: Common HTTP middleware (e.g., request logging, authentication/authorization checks, panic recovery, CORS).
internal/model/:
service.go, request.go: Defines the Go structs that represent your data entities (like Service, ServiceRequestOutput) and Data Transfer Objects (DTOs) like ServiceRequestInput. These are plain data structures.
internal/repository/:
repository.go: Defines interfaces for data access operations (e.g., ServiceRepository with methods like GetAll(), RequestRepository with methods like Create(), GetByID(), List()).
memory/open311_repo.go: An in-memory implementation of the repository interfaces. Good for development and testing.
(postgres)/open311_repo.go (or other DB types): Database-specific implementations of the repository interfaces.
internal/service/:
open311_service.go: Contains the core business logic. It orchestrates operations, validates data, and uses repositories to interact with data. For example, CreateServiceRequest method would validate input, potentially interact with other services, and then use the RequestRepository to save the request.
internal/platform/logger/:
syslog_logger.go: Your syslog logging implementation. Could define an interface for logging and then the syslog implementation for it, allowing easier swapping of logging backends.
api/:
openapi.yaml: (Optional but recommended) If you use OpenAPI (Swagger) to define your API, the specification file would go here.
pkg/:
Publicly available library code. If you have utility functions or components that are generic enough to be used by other Go projects, they can go here. For most typical application development, internal/ is preferred to avoid unintended external dependencies on your app's internals.
configs/:
Example configuration files (e.g., config.dev.yaml, .env.example). These are not Go code but are loaded by the internal/config/ package.
scripts/:
Utility scripts for building, running, testing, deploying, etc.
Key Principles Applied:
Separation of Concerns: Each package has a distinct responsibility (HTTP handling, business logic, data access).
Dependency Injection: Higher-level components (handlers) depend on abstractions (service interfaces), and these dependencies are "injected" (usually in main.go). Services depend on repository interfaces.
Testability: Clear separation makes it easier to write unit tests for services (by mocking repositories) and handlers (by mocking services).
Scalability: As the application grows, you can add new features by creating new handlers, services, or repository methods within their respective packages without heavily impacting other parts.
Clarity: The structure makes it easier for developers (including your future self) to understand where to find specific pieces of code.
